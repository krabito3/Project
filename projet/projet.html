     	<p>Most managers get into leadership positions because of their professional skills. However, it is a well-known fact that good technical skills do not automatically equal the leadership qualities required. After all, managers also need to know how to lead and support employees in the best possible way. This includes competencies such as clear communication, effective time management, and respectful manners. Only with those skills will you be able to create a framework within which employees can be successful.</p>
        <p>Good managers take responsibility for their decisions. They listen and are able to motivate employees and inspire them with their own vision. They are leaders that people like to follow.</p>
        <p>But how do you become a good leader? With effective coaching. This gives you the opportunity to reflect and expand your leadership skills in peace and quiet. Together we will discover what kind of leader you want to be and find strategies to implement your wishes and needs.</p></section>

                                Life coaching helps you keep track of your priorities</p>

     		<p>Does your life feel stuck? Have you lost sight of your goals? Do you lack the self-confidence to take the next step? Do you long to be more in tune with your life again? If such or similar worries weigh down on you, coaching can help you overcome them. Coaching is not about investigating the causes or coming to terms with the past. A life coach is not a psychotherapist. Rather, it is about showing you different perspectives and inspiring you to change your life and dare new things – so that you can harness your full potential.</p>
     		<p>It is important to know that, as a life coach, instead of simply telling you what to do, we will find out what you need to do together in order for you to achieve your goals and regain your sense of motivation and satisfaction.</p></section>
